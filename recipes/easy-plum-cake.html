      We're still seeing plums at the market, so editor Courtney Kassel's
      grandpa's torte is on the menu. This recipe is superb with the Italian
      plums she waits all year for but works with whatever you can get your
      hands on. Our easy version is made with a buttery sponge cake topped with
      sliced plums, cinnamon, and sugar, then baked to perfection. Courtney
      adds, "It's a recipe that tastes like love."
