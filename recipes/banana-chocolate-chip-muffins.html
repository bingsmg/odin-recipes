      As the recipe page for these goodies states, "The right muffin can save
      your day. It can pull you out of a hungry slump or provide a good jolt of
      sugar and nutrients in the morning." And in September, that's just what we
      need. This twist on classic banana bread includes yogurt for extra soft,
      moist results that we can take on the go if needed. Next up? Pumpkin
      Muffins with Streusel Topping. Because, as Courtney says, "who are we
      kiddingâ€”we're happy pumpkin spice season is here."
